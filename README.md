## What it is

<img src="screenshot.png" width="400" />

A simple Mac app that simulates mouse clicks when needed. Highly configurable and easy to use.

## FAQ

### Is it safe?

Yes.

### Why does it ask for Accessibility permission?

The system requires it to let the app "click".

### I gave it Accessibility permission, but it doesn't click

Restart your Mac.

### It requires macOS 10.14, but I have 10.13 or whatever

[Download the older version](https://tars.mahdi.jp/apps/autoclick-1.0.zip), then right-click on the app and select "Open" to open it.

### It will not let me set a hotkey!

You need to add a modifier to your hotkey like command, alt, or control.

Try command+L, it should work.

### Can you make it accept just one key for the hotkey?

No, it's impossible. (and stupid because you won't be able to use that key anymore)

### I want more clicks per second

I found that above 900 the system will freeze so 900 is the limit.

### Can you make a Windows version?

No, I can't. I would have to quit my job, go to school to learn Windows development, then spend months making it, so no. Also, Windows sucks.

### Can I suggest a feature?

No.

### Can you fix a bug?

No.

### Can I contact you for anything about this app?

No. I will not respond.

### Is this app still in development?

No.

### Why?

I've had enough of entitled Roblox kids.
